Notes:
- Single master - single slave is deprecated sine 3.4 iirc

- Replica sets (of at least 3 nodes) are the prefered way

- We can run a e.g. single master, single slave, single arbiter node

- Replica sets on a single machine are useless?

Questions:
- Are we running nodes on different servers?

- We are not using a replset if we run it on the same server...

- Consider single back ups with 'mongodump' (for small data sets) instead of running replica-sets
-- https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/backups/#back-up-with-mongodump
-- this should be fine as long as we don't have complex data, and no unique indexes
